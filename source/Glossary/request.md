Whenever your application or server attempts to send an email to one of your customers via SendGrid, we will record that as a request to your SendGrid dashboard. In simple terms, each time you contact SendGrid with an email and say, "Hey could you deliver this message for me?", that is a request.

Visit [Delivery Metrics]({{root_url}}/Delivery_Metrics/index.html) to find more information about all the statistics SendGrid provides.
