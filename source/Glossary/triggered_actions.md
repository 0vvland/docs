Triggered actions are automatically completed when a specific [triggering event]({{root_url}}/Glossary/triggering_events.html) that you are tracking takes place. These actions must be defined in advance, and they must be associated with a predetermined user and event.

SendGridâ€™s automated email platform, [Threads](http://threads.io/), makes it possible for you to take several different actions depending on the ways in which a specified user interacts with your website or application. An example of a triggered action might be a purchase confirmation or receipt.
