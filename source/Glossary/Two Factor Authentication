Two Factor Authentication - Also known as 2FA, two step verification or TFA (as an acronym), is an extra layer of security that is known as "multi factor authentication" that requires not only a password and username but also something that only, and only, that user has on them, i.e. a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token.

You can turn this security feature on in your Account Settings, however you will need to contact Support to turn this feature off.
