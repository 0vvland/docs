Subscriber List Management - Maintaining good list management is a key element in keeping your users happy. Sending email to someone who has unsubscribed or never signed up in the 1st place is a big no-no in the email game. 

Make sure to check your list stats. You can do this in the marketing app by click on the stats button next to your recipient list name. You can also manage your unsubscribes by clicking the manage unsubscribes button next to your recipient list name. 

Make sure you are sending mail to people who actually want your mail. Otherwise, you will get lots of spam reports, blocks and bounces. 

And Finally make sure you do not buy email lists or engaging in Email Harvesting. For tips on getting your messages to the Inbox, please see our email deliverability page.
