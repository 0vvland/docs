Triggered email is a form of [automated email]({{root_url}}/Glossary/automated_email.html) that is sent only when a specific [triggering event]({{root_url}}/Glossary/triggering_events.html) occurs or a specific user takes a certain action that prompts the delivery of the email. Triggered emails must be set up in advance: you have to specify which event will trigger the delivery of the email.

In the case of SendGridâ€™s automated and behavior driven email platform, [Threads](http://threads.io/), this is accomplished by tracking individual users and the actions that they may take when interacting with your application or website.
