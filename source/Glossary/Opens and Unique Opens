Opens & Unique Opens

SendGrid inserts a small, transparent image into all messages that are being tracked for Opens. When the client application loads images, it pulls the image data from SendGrid servers and registers an Open event. Not all email clients load images by default. Microsoft’s Outlook, Apple’s Mail.app, Mozilla’s Thunderbird, and Google’s Gmail do not load images. As such, there may be many occasions where recipients will have received a message, opened it, and even clicked on a link, and it will never be counted as opened. The “Opens” percentage is the total number of times your users opened your emails, divided by the total number of Delivered messages. The “Unique opens” percentage is the number of unique individuals that have opened your emails, divided by the total number of Delivered messages. This requires that the Open Tracking app be enabled.
