A black hat sender is a sender/company who sends email to recipients who either send to recipients who have not given permission to senders to send to them.  

Not all black hat activity is intentional, though.  Even senders who have permission but send an excessive amount of email, or send at an alarming frequency may be flagged by users as “spam,” which will be identified by the recipients’ ISP, which may throttle your email, send it to spam traps, or totally block your email.  

If your emails are not getting the clicks and opens you expect, you may want to re-evaluate your sending habits.  Take a look at our [email deliverability tips](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Email_Deliverability/index.html) for help in being a white hat sender.
