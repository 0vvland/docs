A **complaint** is when an email recipient identifies an email message as spam or junk by clicking the “report spam” or “mark as junk” button within their email reader. A sender’s complaint rate is calculated by dividing the total number of emails received [by the ISP] by the number of complaints reported by that ISP’s customers.

A high number of complaints can negatively impact your deliverability rate. [You can read more about deliverability here.](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Glossary/email_deliverability.html)
