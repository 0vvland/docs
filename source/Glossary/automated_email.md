Automated email, also known as [triggered email]({{root_url}}/Glossary/triggered_email.html) or behavior-driven email, refers to any email that is programed to be delivered as a response to a specified [event]({{root_url}}/Glossary/triggering_events.html) or action. While traditional [marketing email]({{root_url}}/Glossary/Email_Types/index.html) involves sending a general promotional message to a large list of recipients, automated email allows you to dynamically send targeted, promotional content that is uniquely relevant to an individual recipient.

Examples of automated email include a welcome series [drip campaign]({{root_url}}/Glossary/drip_campaign.html) that is initiated by a new user sign-up or targeted advertisements based on an individual user’s purchase history. 

The ability to send very relevant, timely emails directed to individual recipients makes automated email a uniquely powerful tool for building and nurturing customer relationships, enhancing the image of your brand, and increasing customer engagement.
