Scheduling emails allows the ability to have the email send process to begin at a certain time. For example if I am a retailer who has a promotion starting at 10:00am you have the email land as close to that time as possible. Scheduling can support this. Whether using our marketing app or one of our other APIs you can define parameters on when to send a single email or batches of emails.
