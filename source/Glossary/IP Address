IP Address - An IP address or IP range that is dedicated to a specific domain and organization
In the context of deploying email, this means that a single IP address or IP range is used to send email for multiple domains. The reputation of this IP is based on the aggregate performance of all the senders that use it.
A unique number assigned to each device connected to the Internet. An IP address can be dynamic, meaning it changes each time an email message is deployed, or it can be static meaning it does not change. A static IP address is recommended for senders of commercial email.

If you are on a Silver or above plan you can see your IP reputation and IP address on your Account Overview page.
