Domain - A named Internet address that resolves to the numbered Internet Protocol (IP) addresses computers use to connect. Examples: sendgrid.com, yourdomain.com, google.com. Simply put, itâ€™s the web address your users go to learn about your company. 

If you are on a Silver or above plan you will have your very own dedicated IP address which we encourage you whitelabel. You can find out more about white labeling here and watch a setup video here.
