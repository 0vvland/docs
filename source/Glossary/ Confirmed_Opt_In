Opt-in email is a term used when someone is given the option to receive "bulk" email, that is, email that is sent to many people at the same time. Typically, this is some sort of mailing list, newsletter, or advertising. Without obtaining permission before sending email, the email is unsolicited bulk email, better known as spam.

Making sure your users have the opportunity to give their preference can help you increase your sender reputation and stay out of the spam box.

The term Opt-out refers to several methods by which individuals can avoid receiving unsolicited product or service information. This ability is usually associated with direct marketing campaigns such as telemarketing, e-mail marketing, or direct mail. 

What is Confirmed Opt-In? The Confirmed Opt-In sending practice requires you to send confirmation emails to every registrant asking them to click to confirm their interest in receiving your emails. Conversely, a Single Opt-In is if you accept email addresses at the time of registration and then begin emailing them normally.
