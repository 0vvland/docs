Transactional Emails are emails that are typically related to system and account related activity. A common example of these types of emails
are Password emails, system notifications, and email verification messages.

The parts of a Transactional Email are:

<ul>
    <li>Headers - The information that tells email servers how to route emails, who they are for, and what to do with them.</li>
    <li>Content - The actual information that the customer sees within the email.</li>
    <li>Template - The "pretty" part of the email, everything that is not content that the user sees.</li>
</ul>
