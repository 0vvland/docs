<p>
There is more detailed information about <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/email/">sending email with Django</a> on the Django project website.
</p>

<p>
First start by adding the following to <strong>settings.py:</strong>
{% codeblock lang:python %}
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.sendgrid.net'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'sendgrid_username'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'sendgrid_password'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
{% endcodeblock %}
Then to send email you can do the following:
{% codeblock lang:python %}

from django.core.mail import send_mail
send_mail('Subject here', 'Here is the message.', 'from@example.com', ['to@example.com'], fail_silently=False)
{% endcodeblock %}


{% info %}
You may also send emails with Django by using the <a href="https://github.com/elbuo8/sendgrid-django">sendgrid-django</a> library, which utilizes the <a href="{{ root_url }}/API_Reference/Web_API/index.html">Web API</a> instead of SMTP as the transport mechanism.
{% endinfo %}
