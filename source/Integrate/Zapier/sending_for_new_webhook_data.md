To establish a Webhook on Zapier, you will need only your Zapier account. Zapier will set up a custom webhook url, for information on how to get started using these Webhooks, check [here](https://zapier.com/help/webhooks/#how-get-started-webhooks-zapier).

To link your Webhooks on Zapier to SendGrid, you must have an active SendGrid account. To learn more about getting started with SendGrid basics, start [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/index.html).
