Starting from your newsletter dashboard, you’ll see your global newsletter stats. This graph is showing how all of your newsletters are being received by all of your recipient lists. It’s a global view of all of the sending that you’ve done through this application.

To see the stats from a specific newsletter, select this button ![Email Marketing Stats]({{root_url}}/images/EmailMarketing_Analytics_1.png) on the right-hand side, and choose the desired newsletter.

Here, you’ll have access to:

* Requests
* Deliveries
* [Opens]({{root_url}}/Glossary/opens.html)
* Unique Opens
* [Clicks]({{root_url}}/Glossary/clicks.html)
* Unique Clicks
* Click-through ratio
* Bounces
* Repeat bounces
* [Spam reports]({{root_url}}/Glossary/spam_reports.html)
* Repeat spam reports
* Unsubscribes
* Invalid emails

You can learn more about each of these statistics [here]({{root_url}}/Delivery_Metrics/metrics.html).

You can also view the statistics for your newsletters by selecting “manage” under the “Marketing Email” tab. Here you’ll see a quick preview of many of the metrics that you would look at to see how your newsletter is performing: sent, opens, unique opens, open rate, total clicks, CTR, opt-out/unsubscribe rate, and spam reports.

Here you will also be able to see statistics by recipient list for that newsletter.
