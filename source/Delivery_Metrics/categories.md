Categories can help organize your email analytics by enabling you to "tag" emails by type.

Just as you can view the statistics on all your activity under the '[Statistics]({{root_url}}/Delivery_Metrics/)' tab, you can go a step further and view the statistics broken down to a particular category.

The events that can be associated with category include:

-   Emails sent
-   Clicks
-   Opens
-   Bounces
-   Spam Reports
-   Unsubscribes

The actual statistics included vary depending upon the set of enabled [Apps]({{root_url}}/Apps/). Emails sent, bounces and spam reports will always get tracked. [Unsubscribes]({{root_url}}/Apps/subscription_tracking.html), [Clicks]({{root_url}}/Apps/click_tracking.html), and [Opens]({{root_url}}/Apps/open_tracking.html) require that the associated App is enabled. Check out the [Apps tab](https://sendgrid.com/app) to see which apps you have enabled.
