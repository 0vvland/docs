Browser
{% endanchor %}

<p><a href="https://sendgrid.com/statistics/browsers">The browser
  report</a> shows which browsers are most frequently clicking links in
your mail.</p>

{% info %}
There are similarities between Device and Browser statistics and we are
working on ways to consolidate the data. The current reasoning for two
separate reports is that in some cases an open from a device can result
with a click from a browser that represents the device (e.g. Open on an
Iphone -> Click on an Iphone), in other cases an open from one device
can result in a click from a different browser (e.g. an Open on a desktop computer -> Click on FireFox).
