In order to add a new image to your marketing email image library you must first upload it through an image module within a design template. Check out this&nbsp; [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jhOiKuFRbMY#t=287)&nbsp;for a visual walkthrough.

All images that are uploaded in this manner will remain in the image library indefinitely. Images cannot be uploaded to the library through the custom HTML template option at this time.

&nbsp;

Please note: It is not currently possible to upload images through the API, but you can still reference hosted images&nbsp;inside of html A tags when adding your HTML content.&nbsp;
