SendGrid's focus is on making developers lives easier in the realm of email, and giving our customers the tools to ensure their mail gets delivered to the inbox. While many of our customers do use our Email marketing&nbsp;app to send their marketing emails, we've had customers ask us to add more marketing-specific features that would take away from our core focus, which is scalability and deliverability of email. For list management and&nbsp;auto-responder&nbsp;software, we'd recommend HubSpot or Pardot.

[HubSpot's](http://www.hubspot.com/) highly regarded all-in-one online marketing software simplifies the online marketing process. From search engine optimization, blog traffic analytics, and lead generation, to CRM integration, overall account trends, and email campaign management, HubSpot brings the disparate aspects of online marketing together into one place and makes online marketers more efficient and effective in their efforts. While SendGrid's Newsletter app allows you to upload a list, send out marketing materials, and track statistics on that send, some of our customers choose to leave their transactional mail in our hands and utilize HubSpot for their email marketing campaigns and general online marketing efforts.

[Pardot's](http://www.pardot.com/) Marketing Automation is another buzz-worthy software suite that does a number of the same things as HubSpot. As they mention in the overview on their site their tools include "CRM integration, email marketing, lead nurturing, lead scoring and ROI reporting to help marketing and sales teams work together to generate and qualify sales leads, shorten sales cycles, and demonstrate marketing accountability."&nbsp;More specifically though, their email marketing tools allow for auto-responders, drip marketing, dynamic content, and all the bells and whistles you'd expect in an email marketing tool.

Both HubSpot and Pardot use SendGrid as the delivery engine of their email tools, so if you decide to use one of these services for your email marketing efforts you can expect the same optimized deliverability of your mail SendGrid's become synonymous with.
