By default, we limit the amount of subusers a Pro (or higher) account has to 15. If you find yourself needing more than 15, please contact [SendGrid Support](https://support.sendgrid.com), and we can help you get more added.

Just so you are aware, the support agent will likely ask a few questions about what you will be using subusers for and the volume you might be sending over them. Don't worry though, we're only asking so we can help you have the best experience possible with new subusers. 

Read more about what subusers are, and what features they have  [here]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Account/what_are_subusers.html).
