If you are on a Pro or higher plan you have access to create [subusers]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Account/what_are_subusers.html). Subusers act as standalone accounts that share the parent accountâ€™s credits. This allows for stats tracking that is specific to those subusers as well as unique credentials to access each subuser. This is useful for multiple integrations and is a great option to keep your transactional and marketing emails separate. To setup a subuser, navigate to [Settings > Subuser Management](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/subusers) to get started. Keep in mind that the default limit for subusers is 15. If you need to add more subusers, you can learn more about it [here]({{root_url}}/Classroom/Basics/Account/how_do_i_add_more_subusers_to_my_account.html).

Alternatively, if you would like others to be able to access your primary account without disclosing your primary credentials, you can create multiple user credentials. This option is located under [Settings>Credentials](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/credentials). This is useful if you would like to grant access to another team member or department for the the purposes of reading stats, accessing the UI, and/or sending mail using the primary account.
