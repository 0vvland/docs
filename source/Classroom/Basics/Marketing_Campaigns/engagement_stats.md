Marketing Campaigns has made it easier than ever to gather engagement statistics for each of your campaigns. You can view how many times your campaign was opened, the number of times links were clicked within your campaign, and the specific recipients who either opened or clicked a link within your campaign.

These engagement statistics can provide valuable insight not only into how well your campaigns are performing, but also which exact recipients are the most (or least) engaged with your content.

For detailed instructions on how to view your engagement stats, and how to create a segment of recipients based on these stats, please visit our [User Guide]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/Campaigns/index.html#-Engagement-Statistics).

Creating a dynamic segment of recipients who have either opened one of your campaigns or have clicked links within a campaign can be useful in many ways. You might send them a follow-up email thatâ€™s specifically designed to build on your first campaign. Now that you have more information about _what_ content initially sparked those readers' interest, you can continue the conversation.

Furthermore, recipients who have expressed an interest in your content can also be sent to more frequently. In order to protect your reputation as a sender, it is important to ensure that the people you frequently send campaigns to are genuinely interested in receiving those campaigns. [Engagement statistics]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/Campaigns/index.html#-Engagement-Statistics) can help you seek out these recipients.

Re-Ignite Relationships With Stale Recipients
{% endanchor %}

Identifying recipients who _have not_ engaged with one of your recent campaigns can often be just as useful.

Creating a list of recipients who rarely (or never) engage with your campaigns can help you determine how to modify your message to better target those recipients in the future. Look for patterns in your campaign content and try to correlate those patterns with unengaged recipients.

Occasionally, it is best to simply send to these recipients less frequently.

Sometimes having a very large percentage of unengaged recipients indicates that your contact list is becoming stale.

If you feel that you have an abnormally large number of unengaged recipients, we recommend that you consider sending an email explicitly asking these recipients if they would like to continue hearing from you, and if so, how. This is a smart, simple way to improve your deliverability and maintain your positive reputation as a sender.
