SendGrid recommends confirmed opt-in for all senders&nbsp;of bulk email. This industry recommended best practice helps document permission between sender and recipient, while also eliminating invalid email addresses collected through online forms, in person, or over the phone. It also it single handedly guarantees you cannot continue sending to [Spam Traps](http://support.sendgrid.com/entries/21446941-spam-traps). Some national email laws, [such as CASL](https://sendgrid.com/blog/canadian-anti-spam-law-need-know/), require senders to verify confirmed opt-in upon request.

Good email delivery starts first with sending wanted mail, and confirmed opt-in is an essential first step in establishing that.

The following describes confirmed opt-in, as well as several related terms:

**"Opt-in"** &nbsp;with respect to email describes the permission a subscriber grants to be sent bulk email, such as newsletters and promotions.

**Confirmed opt-in:**

A user submits an email address to be used for future communication, which then triggers an email to be sent to that same address. A mechanism within the email, such as a confirmation link, prompts the owner of that address to verify that they do indeed want to receive email at this address.

Confirmed opt-in helps minimize:

- High Bounce rates
- High Spam Complaint rates
- Blacklistings with ISPs or blacklist services, such as Spamhaus.org
- Bots or individuals with poor intentions from adding bad email addresses to your system, poisoning your recipient lists

**Unconfirmed opt-in** aka **Single opt-in:**

A user submits an email address for receiving communication, which is then immediately added to a bulk email list as an eligible contact for bulk email. &nbsp;However, no mechanism verifies whether this is a valid address, or even if it belongs to the user submitting it. This unverified form of opt-in has a high potential for abuse and delivery problems, since users are not prompted to confirm that the email address is valid or under their control.
