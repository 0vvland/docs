In order to maximize your email deliverability it is important to keep your address list current and clean.&nbsp; What does this mean and why does it matter?&nbsp; A reconfirmation email, otherwise known as a re-opt in email, is a good means to remind clients you once corresponded with about your business (which can increase your inbound marketing), effectively clean your lists with&nbsp;minimal impact to your deliverability,&nbsp;and to prevent&nbsp;inadvertently spamming your clients. You can also use this method as a Win-Back campaign.

&nbsp;

As you opt-in your recipients, the email addresses provided to you initially may become obsolete. These addresses might become abandoned and eventually recycled or converted to spam traps.&nbsp; Another possibility is that your recipients might simply become disinterested in receiving your emails after some time.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This can cause problems for your email deliverability.&nbsp; Old abandoned addresses become undeliverable and subsequent sending will result in bounces.&nbsp; Even your older recipients that had once opted-in to your emails might become disinterested and are more likely to mark your mail as spam, especially if there is no easy opt-out method in the email.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

To prevent these problems, we recommend using re opt-in messages.&nbsp; These emails remind&nbsp;your&nbsp;recipients of your&nbsp;services they once opted into&nbsp;and politely ask for the recipient's permission to continue sending emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;A typical means to do this would be to send an email with two links:&nbsp; one link to re-opt in the recipient, and the other link to opt-out the recipient.&nbsp; If they do not explicitly opt back in with this email, their address should be removed from your list as this is an indication your recipient is not engaging in your emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be a sign that you are sending to someone that does not care for your emails, or even worse, you could be sending to a spam trap.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Ultimately, this is a win-win as you are both reminding your recipients of your services, which helps to keep them in the loop, while you are benefiting by being able to track your recipient engagement and maintaining a clean list.

&nbsp;

If you are set up with SendGrid's Event API, click and open events are an excellent way to track which of your users have been unengaged and might be the best targets for your reconfirmation emails.&nbsp; You can even make your reconfirmation emails specific to a particular segmented list if your address lists are set up in this fashion.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This approach is much more favorable than trying to clean a large old address list all at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sending to a 10-year-old list (or even a 3-month-old list) can produce a high bounce rate and cause your unengaged recipients to mark your emails as spam.&nbsp; Email service providers discourage this type of sending&nbsp;because of these results.&nbsp; Keep in mind, the older the list, the bigger the headache it will be to clean.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

How often and to whom should these be sent out?&nbsp; We recommend sending re opt-in messages to recipients if you haven't&nbsp;corresponded with or otherwise interacted with via email in over 3 months.&nbsp; This may seem like a short duration, however, you might be surprised with how quickly your recipients can lose interest in your emails.&nbsp; Of course there are many types of businesses and this recommendation of 3 months is only a suggestion.&nbsp; You know your business better than anyone so decide what works for you.&nbsp; Ultimately however, the more frequently you clean your address list, the less likely you will be to have deliverability problems related to old lists.

&nbsp;

**Checklist to reconfirmation campaigns:**

-Have link allowing your clients to re-confirm their opt in and a link allowing users to unsubscribe (any recipient addresses that don't engage you must delete)

-Remind the recipient how their address was originally obtained.

-The email should be in HTML/plain and plain/text format. Some recipient domains do not view HTML emails and will only see plain/text emails.

-Sending to a large list of recipients? Send these out in batches to avoid throttling issues with recipient domains.

-Sending two confirmation campaigns can help ensure you are reaching all interested parties. If you do send two reconfirmation campaigns make sure you are informing the recipient there will only be two reconfirmation campaigns and if they unsubscribe or don't engage ,they will never receive an email from you again.

-If you are uncertain about your reconfirmation campaign or suspect high bounce rates, please inform SendGrid's support team. They will contact our Compliance Department to ensure your concerns are being addressed.
