<p>Many hosting providers and ISPs block port 25 as a default practice. When trying to connect to smtp.sendgrid.net remember that ports 25, 2525, 587, and 465 are all available for use.</p>

<p>You can connect via unencrypted or TLS on ports 25, 2525, and 587.
You can connect via SSL on port 465.</p>

<p>Outbound connections for emails sent via SendGrid utilize opportunistic encryption using TLS. When we 
deliver your message to its recipient we will attempt to negotiate a TLS connection with the recipientâ€™s mail server.
If successful, we send using TLS. If not, a plain connection is used.</p>
