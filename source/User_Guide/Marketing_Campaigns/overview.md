When you log into <a href="https://sendgrid.com/marketing_campaigns/overview">SendGrid Marketing Campaigns</a>, you will be able to see 7-day aggregate statistics about your email
campaigns. With the toggles at the bottom of the graph, you can see detailed statistics about requests, deliveries, opens, unique opens, clicks, unique clicks, bounces, spam reports, unique unsubscribes, unique bounces, unique spam reports, and invalid emails.

Set Notifications
{% endanchor %}

If you would like to have notifications sent to an email other than your parent account address, you can opt in to receive email notifications from SendGrid about your account's marketing campaigns activity.  Email notifications about CSV upload summaries, sender verifications, A/B test winner notifications, and list/segment exports will be sent to this account.

To enable this setting, click the "Set Notifications" button in the bottom left corner of any marketing campaigns screen.
