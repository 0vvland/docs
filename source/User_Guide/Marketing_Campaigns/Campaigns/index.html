{% info %}
Accounts are currently limited to 250 campaigns.
{% endinfo %}

When you are ready to send an email campaign, go to the campaigns page and click “Create Campaign.” From here you will be able to choose the template to use for this campaign, add content, and send the email.

{% anchor h2 %}
Choose Your Template
{% endanchor %}

{% info %}
You can also create a campaign from your <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/templates.html">templates list</a>.
{% endinfo %}

We have provided you with multiple default templates to choose from. If you decide to upload your own email design we suggest that you <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/templates.html">create a template</a> so that you can reuse it.

{% warning %}
You must hit "Save" after using the "Paste HTML" box to save your HTML for use in your campaign.
{% endwarning %}

We have also included a Paste HTML option, just click the "Paste HTML" tab, where you can paste your HTML in for one-time use in this campaign.

{% anchor h2 %}
Add Your Content and Manage Your Settings
{% endanchor %}

{% info %}
The editor will autosave your changes every 3 seconds. That way, if you close your browser window your changes will be saved.
{% endinfo %}

Once you choose your template, you will be taken to the campaign editor page.

From here you can change the content in your email without affecting your template, meaning that any changes here will be saved for this campaign only and will not change your template. This allows you to use the same template multiple times without having to worry about changes from campaign to campaign. As you make changes to your campaign, you will notice the “Save” button change to “Saving…” as the editor autosaves your changes.

**Campaign Name:** This is the name of your campaign, so you can find it again from the campaigns page.

{% warning %}
Your <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/senders.html">sender identity</a> must be verified before you use it to send a campaign.
{% endwarning %}

**From Sender:** This is the person from whom this email will be sent. The user will see this name as the sender on their email.

**Email Subject:** The subject line the user will see. Note: You can use substitution tags in order to personalize the email subject for your customers.

**Lists/Segments to Send To:** You can choose which contacts will receive your email. You can choose more than one list or segment. A contact in multiple selected lists will only receive the email once.

**Send Immediately / Schedule:** You can set when this email will be sent to your contacts. “Send Immediately” is selected by default. If you would like to schedule your campaign, click the “On” button to toggle the custom schedule options. Scheduled campaigns will be scheduled only after you click "Schedule" in the upper right hand corner. Remember, your timezone is set in your <a href="https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/account.html">account settings</a>.

**Categories:** This is a category that you can set for your emails, which will help you track delivery metrics in the SendGrid advanced statistics section based on your own classifications of the emails you are sending. To add a category, type the name and press enter.

**Unsubscribe Group:** This allows you to set the group that applies to this email, so that users who have already opted out of emails do not receive them again. In order to keep your sender rating high, it is important to make sure you don’t send emails to users who have unsubscribed in the past. In order to create a new suppression group, please go to the <a href="https://app.sendgrid.com/suppressions/advanced_suppression_manager">Advanced Suppression Manager</a> page to add a new suppression group. Please see our <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Suppressions/index.html">Suppressions docs</a> for more information.

{% warning %}
The test send will be deducted from your email package limit.
{% endwarning %}

{% info %}
This test email will not replace your substitution tags, as you will be sending to an email address and not to a formal contact in your database.
{% endinfo %}

**Send Test Email** - If you want to see the email as your customer would see it, you can enter your email address here and click “Send.” The campaign will be sent to the email specified immediately.

{% info %}
Don't forget that you can use <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marekting_Campaigns/templates.html#-Replacement-Tags">replacement tags</a> for both a weblink and unsubscribe links.
{% endinfo %}

{% anchor h2 %}
A/B Testing Your Campaigns
{% endanchor %}

If you want to test the subject or content of your campaigns before you send it, check out our <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/Campaigns/a_b_testing.html">A/B Testing Guide.</a>

{% anchor h2 %}
Preview Your Campaign
{% endanchor %}

It is good practice to look at your campaign on a couple of different screen sizes. In order to expedite this process for you, we have provided a desktop and mobile preview for you. At the top of your screen you will notice three icons that look like the following:

<img src="{{root_url}}/images/templates_8.png" alt="Desktop Preview" /> is the desktop preview option. It will show you what your users will see when looking at your email through their desktop email application.

<img src="{{root_url}}/images/templates_9.png" alt="Mobile Preview" /> is the mobile preview option. It will show you what your users will see when looking at your email through a mobile email application.

<img src="{{root_url}}/images/templates_10.png" alt="Text Preview" /> is the text preview option, also known as plain text. It will show you what text-only users and screen readers will see when they look at your email.

{% info %}
While the preview functionality we provide will cover many use cases, it will not render the same as all mobile devices or desktop email clients. We recommend you use programs like <a href="https://litmus.com/">Litmus</a> to check that your email renders appropriately across all devices and clients.
{% endinfo %}

{% anchor h2 %}
Save or Send Your Campaign
{% endanchor %}

{% info %}
You cannot resend a campaign once it has been sent!
{% endinfo %}

{% warning %}
Your <a href="{{root_url}}/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/senders.html">sender identity</a> must be verified before you use it to send a campaign.
{% endwarning %}

You have the option to save your campaign, for editing later. Once you are ready to send, you can click the “send” button in the top right corner of this page. If you have chosen to schedule your campaign, it will be sent at the time specified. If you do not schedule your campaign, it will send immediately.

{% anchor h2 %}
View All of Your Campaigns
{% endanchor %}

From the campaigns page, you can view all the campaigns that you have built or sent. High level statistics about each campaign will be available in-line with the name, send date, and status of the campaign. You can also click the gear icon at the right to duplicate, view stats, or preview the campaign.

{% anchor h2 %}
Duplicating a Campaign
{% endanchor %}

To duplicate a campaign that you already have, just click the gear icon to the right of that campaign and choose "duplicate". You will be taken to the campaign builder where you can change the name from the default auto-generated and timestamped campaign name. This will automatically create this campaign in your list, even if you do not click the "save" button.

{% anchor h2 %}
Unschedule a Campaign
{% endanchor %}

From the main campaigns page, you can click the gear icon inline with your campaign and select "Unschedule Campaign". This will put your campaign back into a draft status and remove the schedule date.

{% anchor h2 %}
Campaign Statistics
{% endanchor %}

Once you have sent a campaign, you can click the gear icon next to the campaign name and then choose “stats.” From here, you will get statistics specific to this campaign including bounces, clicks, opens, etc. and you can also export a CSV with the raw stats.
