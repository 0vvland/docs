## Integration
### Will this solution eventually be integrated into my SendGrid Account?
Yes! Currently, the solution lives as a standalone app with a separate access URL. However, it uses your same SendGrid login credentials for access. When the new product is released to the general public in the 2nd half of 2015, it will all live within a single SendGrid customer portal.

### Will I still be able to use the current SendGrid Newsletter product?
Until this solution is made available to the general public, it will live as a separate standalone app. You will be able to use the new Marketing Campaigns app and our current Newsletter app simultaneously, but they do not share any data. You will be charged for your usage on both.

## Early Access Feature Set
What is Early Access? How long will Early Access Last?
SendGrid is rolling out a collection of brand new marketing email features to complement our powerful deliverability engine and current email solutions. Our customers have been the driving force in shaping the features and functions of these new solutions.

### How long will I have to wait to get access?
Based on our initial conversations, we anticipate high demand for Early Access. Our goal is to bring customers on board within 7 days. If your wait time exceeds 7 days, we will contact you with more details.

## Pricing and Billing
### What does Early Access Cost?
The new marketing feature set is included as part of your existing package. Each email sent via the new features will count as a credit toward your monthly package volume. In addition, you will receive a separate charge based on the size of your recipient list: $10 per 10,000 recipients each month. High volume pricing is also available. Please contact our sales team for high volume pricing information. For all customers, the first 2,000 contacts are stored for free.

### How will I be billed?
You will see the Early Access charge added to your monthly bill reflecting your maximum recipient size for the month. Also, each email sent via the new features will count as a credit toward your monthly package volume.
