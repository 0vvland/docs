What is Two-Factor Authentication?
{% endanchor %}

Two-factor authentication, commonly referred to as multi-factor authentication, allows you to make your SendGrid account more secure by requiring authentication beyond a simple username and password when logging in.

SendGridâ€™s Two-Factor Authentication can be configured to accept a code sent to your mobile phone either via the the [Authy App](https://www.authy.com/app/mobile/), or an SMS message.

How To Set Up Two-Factor Authentication
{% endanchor %}

You may choose from two different verification methods when using two-factor authentication:

1. Generating a verification code in the [Authy App](https://www.authy.com/app/mobile/)
2. Entering a code sent to your mobile phone that is generated by SendGrid.
