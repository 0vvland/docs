Categories can help organize your email analytics by enabling you to "tag" emails by type.

Just as you can view the statistics on all your activity under [Statistics]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Delivery_Metrics/index.html), you can go a step further and view the statistics broken down to a particular category.

The events that can be associated with category include:

* Emails sent
* [Clicks]({{root_url}}/Glossary/clicks.html)
* [Opens]({{root_url}}/Glossary/opens.html)
* [Bounces]({{root_url}}/Glossary/bounces.html)
* [Spam Reports]({{root_url}}/Glossary/spam_reports.html)
* [Unsubscribes]({{root_url}}/User_Guide/Email_Deliverability/Subscription_Tracking/index.html)

The actual statistics included vary depending upon the set of enabled [Apps]({{root_url}}/Apps/index.html). Emails sent, bounces and spam reports will always get tracked. [Unsubscribes]({{root_url}}/Apps/subscription_tracking.html), [Clicks]({{root_url}}/Apps/click_tracking.html), and [Opens]({{root_url}}/Apps/open_tracking.html) require that the associated App is enabled. Check out the [Apps tab](https://sendgrid.com/app) to see which apps you have enabled.
