With SendGridâ€™s [Email Scheduling API endpoint]({{root_url}}/API_Reference/SMTP_API/scheduling_parameters.html) you can send large volumes of email in queued batches or target individual recipients by using a UNIX timestamp parameter.

This new functionality:

* Improves efficiency of processing and distributing large volumes of email.
* Reduces email pre-processing time.
* Enables you to time email arrival to increase open rates.
* Is available for free to all SendGrid customers.
