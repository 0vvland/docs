From the [Global Settings](https://sendgrid.com/account/global-settings) page you can change, at a global account level (meaning, for all the things), whether or not plain
text emails will always be converted to HTML or not.

If the box is unchecked, SendGrid will automatically attempt to convert plain text emails to HTML.

If the box is checked, SendGrid will **not** automatically attempt to convert plain text emails to HTML.
