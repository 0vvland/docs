When you create your account, you will put a credit card in for automatic payments. This will allow SendGrid to make the recurring package charges for your account without having to notify you each month of the bill.

You can also go to the [Billing History > Automatic Payments](https://sendgrid.com/billing/automaticPayments) page to change your credit card at any time.

Fill out the form and click "Make Payment" to save your Credit Card information. When you return to the page, you will see the last 4 digits of the most recent credit card you entered listed as the active credit card on the account.
