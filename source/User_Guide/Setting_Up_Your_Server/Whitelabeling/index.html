Whitelabeling your IP addresses to your domain is very important to making sure your email is received as legitimate mail. If you don't whitelabel, receiving servers
may reject your emails because they don't know where the mail originated. <a href="{{root_url}}/Glossary/spf.html">SPF</a> and <a href="{{root_url}}/Glossary/dkim.html">DKIM</a> are both DNS entry standards for proper whitelabeling of IP addresses.
