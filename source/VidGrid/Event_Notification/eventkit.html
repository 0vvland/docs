  <h3>Configuring the EventKit App</h3>
  <p> The EventKit is an open source app that our Support Incubator team built. This app allows you to easily setup our Event API on your server and provides a easy to use reporting system. Ron goes into detail on how to setup the <a href="http://sendgrid.github.io/eventkit/setup.html">EventKit</a> on your server and demonstrates its basic and useful functionality. Please keep in mind that this is open source and we do not provide support for this app. </p>
